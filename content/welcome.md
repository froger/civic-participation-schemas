description: what is this

tldr: we shape participatory democracy data
---
this working group create, maintain and promote civic participation ontology. this ontology follows the following strategies: 

1. be boring over doing a new fancy thing
2. get help over playing the hero
3. re-use schema.org schema over introducing new schema
4. [semantic first](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) over adapt later

## events
- march 2023: [#GovHackathon23](https://opendata.ch/events/govtech-hackathon/) in bern, switzerland.
- present the shema to json-ld and schema.org w3c working group

## roadmap
- consolidate the draft in a rdf format
- open `api.participation-ontology.ch` platform to expose a [triple store](https://semapps.org/docs/triplestore) with data from public [decidim](https://decidim.org) plateforms (at first)
